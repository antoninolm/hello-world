# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Toni and I work as a Business Analyst in Software Development projects. 
Since long I have been wanting to build more technical knowledge in my field, so that I can offer more support to my teammates.
My current position does not allow me to put into practice what I learn in this field, therefore I have created a Github account to apply my learnings to real world scenarios.
Looking forward to coding with you!
